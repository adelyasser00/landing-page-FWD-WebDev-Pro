# Landing Page Project
#### Developed by: Adel Yasser

## Description
<p>The landing page is a webpage that has 4 default sections where the developers could add more sections and the program would dynamically make a navigation bar that would enable the user to view any section by clicking on it from the dynamic navigation bar through a smooth scrolling animation.
The webpage has some nice looking animations depending on which section the user would be viewing at that moment </p>

##  Usage
<p>To scroll to any section the user would like to view, press the corresponding section name from the navigation bar at the top to automatically scroll down and view that section or simply use the mouse scroll to view the desired section.</p>

## Depencencies
<p>The project depends heavily on the helping tips provided by the Udacity project guide as well as documentations provided by Mozilla and w3schools.</p>
